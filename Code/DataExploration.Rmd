set things up
```{r}
rm(list = ls())
library(here)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

suck in data
```{r}
DF <- read.csv(here("Data", "fixed-deaths.csv"), stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
```

age ranges
```{r}
levels(DF$age_at_death)
```


```{r}
levels(DF$Group)
```

i think the way my data is formated is ruining my life
contemplating reorganizing the entire csv......
